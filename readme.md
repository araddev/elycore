# Elysium Core Source
Hello everyone! Sorry for the long time its taking us to release Elysium. We've decided to release the source of the build from december 1st of 2022 to the public and 
see what you guys can do. Feel free to modify this into whatever you prefer and create new things with it. If you perhaps want to contribute to Elysium as a whole you
can fix the code in the source or add features that we haven't thought of yet or don't know how to make. I wish you a happy day and also soon I'll be uploading the UI
source (which will be public from now on)


# Massive credits to heros like Body, EpicCatto and finally arad for working on this for more than a year. If these people didn't exist this wouldn't have ever happened.


If you want to be kind we will not reward your kindness with nothing. If you make a feature or fix some broken code in our SRC and we implement it into the Elysium that 
will be released on this month or April you will be given credits and also will be rewarded with money (If you have PayPal).
